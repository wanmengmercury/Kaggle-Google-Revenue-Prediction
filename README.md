# Kaggle-Google-Revenue-Prediction

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data
The training and testing data used in this project are cleaned through the tran_v2.csv and test_v2.csv in the above link. 


This project is in progress.

The project includes 3 parts:

1. correlation analysis with a nonparametric approach
- What factors are significantly correlated with the transaction revenue at 5% level and how?

2. model comparison
- Among ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, and gradient boositng models, which model should I use for the final prediction?

4. prediction with the gradient boosting model
- how to tune parameters of gradient boositng model to improve prediction precision?

The "data" folder contains the cleaned data for further analysis.
