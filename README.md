# Kaggle-Google-Revenue-Prediction
This project is derived from this Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data.

#### Project Status: Active

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to analyze the factors that are correlated with the Google transaction revenue and to predict the transaction revenue with Google customer data.

### Methods Used
* Spearman's rank correlation
* Hypothesis Testing
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Data Visualization

### Technology
* Python

## Project Description
The project includes 3 parts:

1. Correlation Analysis with a Nonparametric Approach
- What factors are significantly correlated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level and how?

2. Model Comparison
- Among ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models, which model should I use for the final prediction?

3. Prediction with the Gradient Boosting Model
- How to tune parameters of the gradient boosting model to improve prediction precision?


## Needs of this project

- data processing/cleaning
- machine learning modeling

## Getting Started

1. Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data
2. The training and testing data used in this project are cleaned through the tran_v2.csv and test_v2.csv in the above link. 
3. The cleaned data are kept in the [data](https://github.com/wanmengmercury/Kaggle-Google-Revenue-Prediction/tree/main/data) folder.
