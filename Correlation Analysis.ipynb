    "# Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION: Are the numerical variables(X's) below correlated with the transaction revenue*(Y) and how? \n",
    "\n",
    "*: 'transaction revenue' specifies the total revenue or grand total associated with the transaction (e.g. 11.99). This value may include shipping, tax costs, or other adjustments to total revenue that you want to include as part of your revenue calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical variables(X's) are:\n",
    "- visitNumber: The session number for this user. If this is the first session, then this is set to 1.\n",
    "- totals.hits: Common hit types include page tracking hits, event tracking hits, and ecommerce hits. \n",
    "- totals.pageviews: Pageviews is a metric defined as the total number of pages viewed.\n",
    "- totals.timeOnSite:(https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1006253?hl=en)\n",
    "- totals.newVisits: New users are users who have never been to your website, according to Google’s tracking snippet; returning users have visited your site before. If the cookie is not present, Google creates one and considers this a ‘new’ user. \n",
    "- totals.transactions: 'transactions' represent unique orders on your online store\n",
    "- totals.totalTransactionRevenue: aggregate data of 'totals.TranscationRevenue'.\n",
    "- totals.bounces: A bounce is a single-page session on your site. In Analytics, a bounce is calculated specifically as a session that triggers only a single request to the Analytics server, such as when a user opens a single page on your site and then exits without triggering any other requests to the Analytics server during that session. \n",
    "\n",
    "*totals: features with \"totals\" mean that this set of columns mostly includes high-level aggregate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "METHOD:\n",
    "When it comes to discovering the correlation between variables, one may think of using Pearson's correlation analysis. The drawbacks of Pearson r are that \n",
    "1)if you use Pearson correlation, it means that you assume the (x, y)'s are from a bivariate normal distribution;\n",
    "2) The Pearson r can be highly influenced by outliers.\n",
    "Since the (x, y)'s are not from the normal distribution, it is better to use a non-parametric approach, i.e. Spearman's rank correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HYPOTHESIS TESTING:\n",
    "- H_0: ρ = 0 (no asscociation between X_i and y)\n",
    "- H_1: ρ != 0 (no asscociation between X_i and y)\n",
    "\n",
    "- test statistics: \n",
    "t_obs_spear = r_sp[0] * math.sqrt((len(X) - 2) / (1 - r_sp[0]**2))\n",
    "- significance level: 5%\n",
    "- decision rule: we reject H_0 if and only if |t_obs_spear| >= t_alpha/2_n-2\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the visitNumber is positively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the totals.hits is postively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the totals.pageviews is positively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the totals.timeOnSite is positively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the totals.newVisits is negatively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the totals.transactions is positively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the totals.totalTransactionRevenue is positively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
    "- We reject H_0 and claim that the totals.bounces is negatively associated with the transaction revenue at the 5% level.\n",
